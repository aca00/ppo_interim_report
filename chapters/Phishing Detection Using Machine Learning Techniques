\subsection{Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning
Techniques}

The Internet has become an indispensable part of
our life, However, It also has provided opportunities to anonymously
perform malicious activities like Phishing. Phishers try
to deceive their victims by social engineering or creating mockup
websites to steal information such as account ID, username,
and password from individuals and organizations. Although many
methods have been proposed to detect phishing websites, Phishers
have evolved their methods to escape from these detection
methods. One of the most successful methods for detecting these
malicious activities is Machine Learning. This is because most
Phishing attacks have some common characteristics which can
be identified by machine learning methods.

The paper provide a comparative and analytical
evaluation of different machine learning methods on detecting
the phishing websites in section I. The machine learning methods that
are studied are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random
Forest, Ada-Boost, Support Vector Machine, KNN, Artificial
Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The rest
of the paper is organized as follows: in section II the paper list some
widely used phishing techniques which are link manipulation,filter evasion,website forgery,convert redirect,social engineering,etc. in Section III discussion of
different types of phishing and phishing attack prevention
methods are done.Some of the phishing detection methods explained are list-based approach ,visual similiarity-base approach and machine learning based approach. In section IV an overview of different machine learning methods for phishing detection are provided. In section
V  the features of our dataset are illustrated. In section VI and
VII  evaluation results of suggested machine learning
methods are shown and finally draw conclusions and discuss future
works in section VIII.

 This research have implemented and evaluated twelve
classifiers on the phishing website dataset that consists of
6157 legitimate websites and 4898 phishing websites.
